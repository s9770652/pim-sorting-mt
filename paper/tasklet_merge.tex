Two-way bottom-up \MS{}~\cites{katajainen1997meticulous}[85\psq]{maurer1974datenstrukturen}[Section~2.3.1]{wirth1975algorithmen} repeatedly compares two elements and \emph{merges} them to form sorted couples.
Once only couples (and perhaps one single element) remain, the couples are merged into quadruplets, the quadruples into octuplets and so on until a single sorted sequence remains.
Sorted sequences are also referred to as \emph{runs}.
\MS{} has a guaranteed runtime of \(\bigoh{n \log n}\) and is the only stable sorting algorithm with subquadratic runtime presented in this \lcnamecref{sec:tasklet}.
Its biggest drawback is that additional space of size \(\bigtheta{n}\) is needed.
