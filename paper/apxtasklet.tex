\chapter{Further Measurements on Sorting Sequentially in WRAM}
\label{apx:tasklet}

This \lcnamecref{apx:tasklet} contains a comprehensive collection of measurements expanding the content of \cref{sec:tasklet}.
Every measurement was repeated a thousand times with the sorting algorithms in their default configuration unless explicitly noted otherwise:
\begin{description}
	\item[\IS{}]
	explicit sentinel value

	\item[\ShS{}]
	explicit sentinel values;
	step sizes \(\stepsizes = (1, 6)\) for inputs with at most 64 elements and \(\stepsizes = (1, 4, 17)\) for longer ones

	\item[\HS{}]
	top-down for 32-bit integers;
	bottom-up with swap disparity for 64-bit integers

	\item[\QS{}]
	fallback threshold of 18 elements;
	random medians as pivots;
	prioritisation of right-hand partitions over left-hand partitions;
	iterative for 32-bit integers;
	recursive for 64-bit integers;
	\Cref*{imp:triviality_before_call}

	\item[\MS{}]
	half-space;
	starting run length of 16 elements
\end{description}
Some figures include tinted areas around the plots.
These denote the three-sigma range, that is the 99.7\% confidence intervals.
