\section{Sorting with One Tasklet}

This section covers the very first phase where each tasklet sorts on its own, \ie{} sequentially.
Unless specified otherwise, every measurement shown in this section was conducted on a uniform input distribution with each 32-bit integer, and the default configurations of the sorting algorithms were as follows:
\begin{description}
	\item[\IS{}]
	using one explicit sentinel value

	\item[\ShS{}]
	using \(h_1\) sentinel values

	\item[\QS{}]
	iterative implementation;
	switching to \IS{} whenever 13 elements or less remain in a partition;
	median of three as pivot;
	prioritising the right-hand partition over the left-hand partition
\end{description}
Further measurements can be found in \cref{apx:single}.
