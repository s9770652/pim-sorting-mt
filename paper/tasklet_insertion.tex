\section{\texorpdfstring{\IS{}}{InsertionSort}}
\label{sec:tasklet:insertion}

\IS{} works by moving the \(i\)th element leftwards as long as its left neighbour is greater, assuming that the elements with indices \(0\) to \(i - 1\) are already sorted \cites[83]{maurer1974datenstrukturen}[Chapter~2.2.1]{wirth1975algorithmen}.
Its asymptotic runtime is above the theoretical minimum of \(\bigoh{n \log n}\), reaching \(\bigoh*{n^2}\) not only in the worst case but also in the average case, since any of the \(\binom{n}{2}\) pairs of input elements is in wrong order, needing to be swapped at some point in the execution, with probability \qty{50}{\percent}.
Nonetheless, \IS{} does have some saving graces:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item
	If the input array is mostly or even fully sorted, the runtime drops down to \(\bigoh{n}\).

	\item
	It works in place, needing only \(\bigoh{1}\) additional space.

	\item
	The sorting is stable.

	\item
	Its implementation is short, lending itself to inlining.

	\item
	The overhead is small.
\end{enumerate}
Especially the last two points make \IS{} a good fallback algorithm for asymptotically better sorting algorithms to use on short subarrays.
