		The \MS*{} use a \ShS{} with the step sizes \(\stepsizes = (1)\) for length 16, \(\stepsizes = (6, 1)\) for lengths 24 to 48, and \(\stepsizes = (12, 5, 1)\) for lengths 64 and 96, respectively.

Three implementations have been tested:
full space \MS{} without write-backs, full space \MS{} with write-backs, and half space \MS{}.
\Cref{fig:merge:starting_runs,fig:merge:starting_runs_uint32sorted,fig:merge:starting_runs_uint32uniform,fig:merge:starting_runs_uint64sorted,fig:merge:starting_runs_uint64uniform} show their performance for various starting run lengths.
Please note that the plots are smoothed:
Whenever the number of rounds increments, the runtimes hike, making the zigzagging plots cross each other unswervingly and, thereby, hard to read.
Thence, the figures contain marks for select measurements only in such a way that the resulting plots act as an upper bound on the runtime.

The measurements show that the \MS*{} guarantee a runtime of \(\bigoh{n \lb n}\) as expected.
The differences in runtime between the different input distributions are small compared to \QS{} and are ascribable to \ShS{} and to the differing suitability of the unrolling;
cases where the usage of \ShS{} worsened the runtime are unbeknown.

Even though the tested starting run lengths range from 16 to 96 elements, the mean runtime differences are surprisingly small.
Notwithstanding that the optimal choice depends on the specific input length because of the zigzagging, a starting run length of 32 elements fares decidedly well on average across all tested scenarios.

The half-space \MS{} delivers a strong performance despite its vastly lower memory footprint.
With 32-bit integers, it beats the full-space \MS{} without write-backs by 11\% on sorted inputs and effectively ties on all other inputs but the reverse sorted ones where it narrowly falls behind.
Naturally, the full-space \MS{} with write-backs is consistently (with the exception of reverse sorted inputs) at a disadvantage, despite seeing some light with inferior starting run lengths.
With 64-bit integers, the full-space \MS{} without write-backs manages to turn the ties into scant leads in the range from 1\% to 3\%.
Using the \MS{} with write-backs is still unprofitable.

In summary, a proper implementation of half-space \MS{} with deferred copying and fine-tuned unrolling would require some work but has the potential to be the overall best stable sorting algorithm.
