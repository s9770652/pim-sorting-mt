\chapter[Further Measurements on Sorting in the \texorpdfstring{\abb{MRAM}}{MRAM}]{Further Measurements on \\ Sorting in the \acs*{MRAM}}
\label{apx:mram}

This \lcnamecref{apx:mram} contains a comprehensive collection of measurements expanding the content of \cref{sec:mram}.
Every measurement was repeated ten times with the sorting algorithms in their default configuration unless explicitly noted otherwise.
By default, \cachesize{} is set to 1024, \seqreadcachesize{} is set to 512, and \ac{WRAM} \QS{} is used during the formation of starting runs.
