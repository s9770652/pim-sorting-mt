\section{Sorting with One Tasklet}

This section covers the very first phase where each tasklet sorts on its own, \ie{} sequentially.
Every measurement in this section was repeated a thousand times on a uniform input distribution with 32-bit integers, and the default configurations of the sorting algorithms were as follows:
\begin{description}
	\item[\IS{}]
	using one explicit sentinel value

	\item[\ShS{}]
	using explicit sentinel values

	\item[\QS{}]
	fallback threshold of 18 elements;
	random median as pivot;
	prioritising the right-hand partition over the left-hand partition;
	iterative for 32-bit integers;
	recursive for 64-bit integers;
	\Cref{imp:triviality_before_call}

	\item[\MS{}]
	half space;
	starting run length of 32 elements

	\item[\HS{}]
	top-down for 32-bit integers;
	bottom-up with swap disparity for 64-bit integers
\end{description}
The meaning behind and reasoning for the individual parameters are subject of this section.
Any deviation from these configurations will be specifically mentioned.
Further measurements can be found in \cref{apx:tasklet}.
