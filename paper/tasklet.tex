\label{sec:tasklet}

This \lcnamecref{sec:tasklet} is concerned with sequentially sorting data which fits into the \ac{WRAM} entirely.
\Cref{sec:tasklet:insertion} discusses \IS{} which is a component of all algorithms presented thereafter as it is lightweight and performant on short inputs.
\Cref{sec:tasklet:shell} covers \ShS{} which is a generalisation of \IS{}.
\hyperref[sec:tasklet:heap]{\nameCrefs{sec:tasklet:heap} }\labelcref{sec:tasklet:heap}, \labelcref{sec:tasklet:quick}, and \labelcref{sec:tasklet:merge} deal with \HS{}, \QS{}, and \MS{}, respectively, which are more elaborate algorithms suitable for long inputs.
These \lcnamecrefs{sec:tasklet:insertion} give a short presentation of their respective algorithm at the beginning, ensued by a discussion of key parameters in their designs.
This is usually followed by an insight into non-algorithmic challenges faced during development caused by the compiler whose optimisations are often of suboptimal quality.
Finally, an evaluation of the performance of the respective algorithm completes each \lcnamecref{sec:tasklet:insertion}.
\Cref{sec:tasklet:conclusion} summarises the findings on the presented algorithms and gives a brief outlook on future improvements.

\Cref{apx:tasklet} contains a comprehensive collection of measurements but the ones essential for following the content of this \lcnamecref{sec:tasklet} are also presented in figures herein.
Every measurement was repeated a thousand times with the sorting algorithms in their default configuration unless explicitly noted otherwise.
The meaning behind and reasoning for the individual parameters in the configurations are subject in \crefrange{sec:tasklet:insertion}{sec:tasklet:merge} but shall be mentioned already for ease of reference:
\begin{description}
	\item[\IS{}]
	explicit sentinel value

	\item[\ShS{}]
	explicit sentinel values;
	step sizes \(\stepsizes = (1, 6)\) for inputs with at most 64 elements and \(\stepsizes = (1, 4, 17)\) for longer ones

	\item[\HS{}]
	top-down for 32-bit integers;
	bottom-up with swap disparity for 64-bit integers

	\item[\QS{}]
	fallback threshold of 18 elements;
	random medians as pivots;
	prioritisation of right-hand partitions over left-hand partitions;
	iterative for 32-bit integers;
	recursive for 64-bit integers;
	\Cref*{imp:triviality_before_call}

	\item[\MS{}]
	half-space;
	starting run length of 16 elements
\end{description}

The measurements were confined to at most \num{1024} elements.
The reason is that \qty{64}{\kibi\byte} of \ac{WRAM} are available and that most kernels will run with at least 11 tasklets to saturate the instruction pipeline.
In consequence, at most \qty{5957}{\byte} are allotted to each tasklet.
To account for the tasklet stack, this number is reduced by \qty{600}{\byte}, leaving space for about \num{1339} 32-bit elements.
On that score, 1024 elements is a reasonable cutoff.
