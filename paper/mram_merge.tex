\section{Sequential \texorpdfstring{\MS{}}{MergeSort}}
\label{sec:mram:merge}

The \ac{MRAM} \MS{} is based on the full-space \ac{WRAM} \MS{} as presented in \cref{sec:tasklet:merge} so only the adaptations of the merging to the two-tier memory hierarchy are discussed.
As precondition for the presented algorithm to work, it is demanded that run sizes be multiples of~8 and that the runs and the output location be aligned to 8 bytes.
This precondition simplifies \acp{DMA} and is trivially met for 64-bit elements.
To meet it for 32-bit elements, one can insert a single dummy element set to the maximum possible value into the input and discard the last element of the sorted output.
