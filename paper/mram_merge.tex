\section{Sequential \texorpdfstring{\MS{}}{MergeSort}}
\label{sec:mram:merge}

The \ac{MRAM} \MS{} is based on the full-space \ac{WRAM} \MS{} as presented in \cref{sec:tasklet:merge} so only the adaptations of the merging to the memory hierarchy are discussed.
As precondition for the presented algorithm to work, it is required that run sizes be multiples of eight and that the runs and the output location be aligned to \qty{8}{\byte}.
This precondition simplifies \acp{DMA} and is trivially met for 64-bit elements.
To meet it for 32-bit elements, one can insert a single dummy element, set to the maximum possible value, into the input and discard the last element of the sorted output.
