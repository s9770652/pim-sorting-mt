\section{A \texorpdfstring{\MS{}}{MergeSort} for MRAM Data}
\label{sec:mram:merge}

The MRAM \MS{} is based on the full-space WRAM \MS{} as presented in \cref{sec:tasklet:merge} so only the adaptations of the merge process to the two-tier memory hierarchy are discussed.
As precondition for the presented algorithm to work, it is demanded that the sizes of the runs be multiples of~8 and that the runs and the output location be aligned on 8 bytes.
This precondition simplifies DMAs and is trivially met for 64-bit elements.
To meet them for 32-bit elements, the parallel \MS{} (\cref{sec:par}) divides the work amongst tasklets accordingly and, if need be, introduces dummy elements.
First, the general MRAM merge process with basic optimisations is presented and, thereafter, several optimisations concerning sequential readers.
