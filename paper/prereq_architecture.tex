\section{Architecture}
\label{sec:prereq:arch}

This \lcnamecref{sec:prereq:arch} serves as an introduction to \ac{PIM} on an \upmem{} system in terms of both hardware and software, laying the foundation for understanding the design choices in \cref{sec:tasklet,sec:mram}.
\Cref{sec:prereq:arch:overview} provides a short conspectus of the buildup of such a system, and \cref{sec:prereq:arch:structure} presents the components of an individual \ac{PIM} chip.
\Cref{sec:prereq:arch:pipeline} covers the instruction pipeline, which differs in key aspects from that of modern \ac{CPU}, whilst \cref{sec:prereq:arch:isa} is concerned with the instruction set architecture, as acquaintance with it helps frequently in identifying optimisation potential.
Finally, \cref{sec:prereq:arch:code} gives an insight into developing programs for an \upmem{} system.
The four sources for this \lcnamecref{sec:prereq:arch} are a white paper by \upmem{}~\cite{upmem2021WhitePaper}, a talk given by \upmem{}'s founder, Fabrice Devaux, at the 31st Hot Chips Symposium~\cite{upmem2019HotChips}, the official documentation of the \upmem{} toolchain~\cite{upmemSDK}, and an extensive study by \citeauthor{mutlu2022Benchmarking}~\cite{mutlu2022Benchmarking}.
For the sake of clarity, most statements will not be given a specific source.
