\subsection{\QS{}}

\QS{} uses partitioning to sort in an expected average runtime of \(\bigoh{n \log n}\):
A pivot element is chosen from the input array, then the input array gets scanned and elements bigger or smaller than the pivot are moved to the right or left of the pivot element, respectively.
Finally, \QS{} is called on the left and right subarrays.
