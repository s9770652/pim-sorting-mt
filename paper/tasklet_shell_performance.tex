Let us first focus on short input arrays where only two passes with step sizes~\(\stepsizes_1\) and \(1\) suffice.
The previous results on \IS{} suggest that the fastest \ShS{} should make use of~\(\stepsizes_1\) sentinel values.
\Cref{fig:shell:two-tier,fig:shell:two-tier_uint32,fig:shell:two-tier_uint64} show that, with the exception of the \ShS{} with step size \(\stepsizes_1 = 2\), the additional passes start to pay off at around 16 elements for both 32-bit and 64-bit values with the fully random input distributions, reaching a speed-up of around 15\% at around 24 elements.
In case of the reverse sorted input, the speed-up is practically always positive even for very short inputs, reaching between 50\% and 110\% at around 24 elements.

When moving to greater input lengths (\cref{fig:shell:three-tier,fig:shell:three-tier_uint32reverse,fig:shell:three-tier_uint32uniform,fig:shell:three-tier_uint64reverse,fig:shell:three-tier_uint64uniform}), the differences in performance between the two-tier \ShS*{} become more pronounced;
%especially the ones with \(\stepsizes_1 = 3\) and \(\stepsizes_1 = 4\) fall off whereas the one with \(\stepsizes_1 = 6\) holds its ground quite well.
Between 48 and 64 elements, three passes get worthwhile to consider.
%Interestingly, many \ShS*{} with \(\stepsizes_2 = 4\) take the lead whilst the ones with \(\stepsizes_2 = 6\) are mid-table.
On the one hand, the results are in accordance with \citeauthor{10.1007/3-540-44669-9_12}~\cite{10.1007/3-540-44669-9_12} who, for 128 elements, determined \(\stepsizes = (1, 9)\) to be the optimal pair and \(\stepsizes = (17, 4, 1)\) to be the optimal triplet.
On the other hand, the gain from doing three passes is far smaller:
While \citeauthor{10.1007/3-540-44669-9_12} calculated an average speed-up of 33\% over doing two passes, while it is only 16\% on a DPU.
In opposition to his results, this also makes it unlikely that doing four passes would already net any gain at this input length.
Without access to \citeauthor{10.1007/3-540-44669-9_12}'s original code, giving a satisfactory explanation for the discrepancy is hard, however.

But would pushing the limits of \ShS{} even be rewarding?
Firstly, greater input lengths require greater steps \Dash well into the three digits for \(n \approx 1000\) \cite{skean2023optimization, 10.1007/3-540-44669-9_12} \Dash and those in turn require more sentinel values.
Implicit sentinel values could provide relief since the slow-down from implicitness should trend to zero for longer inputs, as was the case for \IS{}.
Secondly, finding the best step sizes for longer inputs requires a lot more work because the length and, thus, the number of reasonable combinations of step sizes become larger and, as also seen in this subsection, longer optimal tuples cannot be constructed straightforwardly from shorter optimal ones.

Its application, on the other hand, would likely be niche.
\ShS{} is outperformed by other algorithms presented hereafter, and those have no use for a \ShS{} adjusted to longer inputs.
Its only saving grace could be its in-place property combined with medium speed, although even with relying solely on implicit sentinel value, not much space would be saved compared to the fastest sorting algorithm, namely \QS{}.
