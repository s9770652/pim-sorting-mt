\chapter{Prerequisites}
\label{sec:prereq}

This \lcnamecref{sec:prereq} lays the necessary groundwork for understanding the design principals of our proposed algorithms.
\Cref{sec:prereq:arch} serves as an introduction to \acl{PIM} on an \upmem{} system mainly in terms of hardware, but major implications for designing code are also covered.
\Cref{sec:prereq:sorting} establishes necessary terminology in the context of sorting algorithms.
In addition, an insight into some modern sorting algorithms and the reasons for their high performance is provided, along with a discussion on the applicability of the methods to the \upmem{} architecture.
